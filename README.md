# I didn't write this.

I'm hacking on the source code of http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/ for fun.  

If you want the original game (as of 10/10/17 when I saved the files from my browser), check out the `vanilla` branch.

## Changes made:

* Uncommented the cheat buttons
* Made cheats increase exponentially so that they could keep up with the game
* Fixed +1 trust button for when that's expressed via drone gifts instead
